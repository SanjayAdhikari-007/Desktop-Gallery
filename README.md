# Desktop Gallery

Have you noticed when opening webp image file using Windows Photo Viewer, it just shows the static image without any animated content? To view animated contents of webp file you need a web browser. Viewing images in the web browser isnâ€™t user-friendly as it doesn't support shortcut keys to view the next or previous image. So, I have made an app that solves this problem using Flutter and Win32 API for Windows.
